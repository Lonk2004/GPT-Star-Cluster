# Images to API: Upload Astronomical FITS Images to Imgur

## Overview
This notebook provides a complete utility for processing astronomical FITS images, applying custom preprocessing (arc-sinh scaling and cropping), encoding them as Base64 PNGs, and uploading them to Imgur via API calls. The resulting image URLs are saved into a `.txt` file for easy reference or downstream API batch processing.

## üì¶ Key Features

- **FITS Image Processing**:
  - Cropping around the central region.
  - Arc-sinh scaling to enhance faint structures (similar to DS9 visualizations).
- **Base64 Encoding**:
  - Converts preprocessed images into Base64 format suitable for API uploads.
- **Automated Uploading**:
  - Uploads images to Imgur using their API.
  - Saves all returned image URLs into a specified `.txt` file.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully manages rate limits (HTTP 429 errors).
- **Batch Preparation**:
  - Prepares images for sending in batches to downstream APIs.
